        Helloooo. I want to start by saying how great this morning was for me. It was just one of those morning where I actually nailed it. I just nailed it all. And it all began yesterday at sundown. I stopped what I was doing at sundown to go home and get prepared for the next day. And the result...

        <strong>4:00 AM</strong> - I woke up to the sounds of The Showman. I had it playing through the night to serve as somewhat of an affirmation. That movie is so damn uplifting it's crazy. And I actually woke up to the exact song that I layed down to. I figured I would wake up more positive but I'm not going to lie, I was still pretty weak to get up.

        I made a killer ginger potion right after I woke up around <strong>4:30 AM</strong>. Haha I had some fun posting the process of making the potion on snapchat. I made a story of it if you want to check it out &#64;derrickhabenero . But overall the potion did it's job. I actually went through 3 major detoxification processes if you catch my drift. It's such an effective way to eliminate and it doesn't taste so bad if you put cinnamon in it. oooh and the magic ingredient is key as well haha.

        As I drank my tea I caught up with my notebook and jotted a few things down that were on my mind. I wrote something like this "Hey Billy, good morning! Today you are going to smash it man. You can do it.". I like to think that i'm the one standing in the way of my own destiny. So I just want to talk to myself and touch base. But while I was at it I read a few motivational words about health and vitality from one of my health books. For some reason reading those words reminds me of how crucial health is. Health &gt; Pleasure.

        <strong>6:00 AM</strong> - At this time the sun started to rise so I knew I had to get going with my routine if I wanted to make it outside in time to watch the forest come to life. So I began stretching and finished my tea. The stretch sesh was a good sesh. Stretching just feels amazing. One thing I wish I would of done is use the foam roller ah well. Tomorrow.

        <strong>7:00 AM</strong> - I made it outside just as the sun started making his move with time to spare before work. Lets just say it was perfect. It was chilly but it didn't bother me at all. I even ditched the boots to walk down to the creek barefoot. I got down to the creek and really didn't know what to do but I clutched a youtube video which was funny. Then I decided I wanted to livestream myself sitting still observing nature. And so I did. I streamed a solid hour on Twitch for the first time and I got like 5 views. Like, what? lol.
