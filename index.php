        Today is interesting because I am practicing new habits and also working on my new setup. I am looking forward to eating some potatos in a minute and i should probably go check on them soon.

        So after my tea I enjoyed some of my books and played some music on my strings of guitars. After that I made sure to practice my muscles and stretch them good. After that we went out and practice a few other things I hold dear to my heart.

        I had a pretty interesting time in the forest today, we were pressed on time so I took a short little video of the experience.
